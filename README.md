# Chrome-ShareSFRecord
This plugin is used to share any record details to anyone through email. No need for the second user to have SF license.

Want to share data of a record from detail page quickly? Just hit share button and plugin will get all the non null fields data and form a mail ready to be sent.

NOTE - 
Limitations - 
1. This plugin uses mailto: functionality to send email or call out the default app. Please check your default protocol settings or Handler settings under "chrome://settings/handlers" for proper opening of mail tab with details.

2. mailto opens a new url on new tab and there is a limitation around number of characters in url, so right now plugin supports data till 2000 characters which is generally more than sufficient for most records.


Future - 
1. Data share through hosted link
2. Downloadable file with data
Please leave a message on what new features you may want more as future release features.
